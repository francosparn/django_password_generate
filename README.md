# :rocket: Django Password Generator

This is a web application that generates strong passwords randomly and is developed with the **Django** framework.

Passwords can be **generated with capital letters**, **symbols** and **numbers**, with a **minimum length of 6 characters** and a **maximum of 14**.

For the structure and design of the application, **HTML**, **CSS** and version 5 of the **Bootstrap** framework were used.

To **update** and **copy** the generated password, a few lines of native **JavaScript** were used.

Icons used are from **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)**.

## Project run

To run this project you will need to have **Python** installed on your computer. The first thing we will do is download the project and open it in our preferred editor. Although not required, it is recommended that you create a **virtual environment** to store your project dependencies separately.

To install a **virtual environment**, run the following command:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

If your operating system is **Windows**, open **"Command Prompt"** and run the following command:

```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

If your operating system is **Linux** or **Mac**, open **"Terminal"** and run:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Next, install the project dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is almost ready, now it only remains to execute the project with the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```
